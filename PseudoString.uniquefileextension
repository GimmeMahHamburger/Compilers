~A demonstration of c-string-like segments of characters. I don't know how else I'd store strings without some more complicated user-defined (or built-in) structs.

char $ example = 'example'

_example write
_example[3] write
_'\n' write

example[4] = '5'
_example write
_'\n' write

example[5] = void
_example write
_'\n' write

~~~
Expected output:
examplem
exam5le
exam5
~~~
