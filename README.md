# Compiler homework for CPSC 5400 01
This is the current load of progress made towards a custom language.

The code structure for the whole assignment has been adapted from the "tutorial" project provided on the AntLR website.
I have copied the file setup and discarded pretty much all the files the project came from. 
If needed, I will gladly verify/demonstrate/describe which files are mine, which files are generated from my code, and which files are leftover from the setup.
I just really didn't want to have to set up VS2022 myself, I've never been good at it, especially when adding foreign .dll's and stuff.
The project is located at Code/Demos/Windows. I haven't moved anything around because of my aforementioned lack of knowledge, specifically concerning what is and isn't necessary for the whole project to function/compile.
